# What is Fuzzy Darts?
Fuzzy Darts is the code name given to the app that handles all kinds of profile matching

# What is Profile Matching?
Profile matching consists of quantitivately generating a score between two profiles using criteria selected for each profile.

# How are Criteria Selected?
Criteria is a list of curated criterion chosen by the profile maker. Criterion include Education, Compensation, Language Skills, and much more

Each profile will have a list of 'has' criteria and 'wants' criteria. The 'wants' criteria from one profile will be matched with the 'has' criteria from another profile

# Cool! How do I begin?
First, you'll need to create an account. Your account will hold all profiles managed by you.

Then, create your profile(s) for your new account.

Once a profile has been created, you can add criteria to that profile.

See the [Wiki](#) page for information on each Criterion and how to configure it to best fit your profile
